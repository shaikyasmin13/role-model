<center><img src="role model.jpg"></center><br>
<hr><pre><b>Ismail ibn Musa Menk</b> (born 27 June 1975) is a <i>Zimbabwean Islamic scholar</i>. He is the Grand Mufti[5][6] of Zimbabwe's Muslim community,[7][8] and head of the fatwa department for the Council of Islamic Scholars of Zimbabwe<br></pre>
<b>VIEWS</b><br>Menk opposes terrorism and has pledged his aid in curbing religious extremism in the Maldives.[21] On 31 March 2018, he urged Liberian Muslims to avoid Muslim—Christian violence, arguing that Muslims and Christians are brothers and sisters from one father, the prophet Adam.[22] He blames western media for misleading the world that Muslims are terrorists.[23] According to Gulf News, Menk said that everyone on this earth is a part of a family and has one maker, therefore, no one has the right to force any belief or faith on another.[24]
In September 2023, Mufti Menk visited Trinidad and Tobago during his special visits in the Caribbean.[25] MP Saddam Hosein, while sharing a Facebook post expressed that he is honored with a visit from an international beacon of peace and understanding.[26]<br>
<b>AWARDS AND RECOGNITION</b><br>
<mark>Menk was honoured with an Honorary Doctorate of Social Guidance by Aldersgate College</mark>, Philippines and its collaborative partner Aldersgate College – Dublin, Ireland on 16 April 2016.[30]
KSBEA 2015 Awards – Global Leadership Award in Social Guidance was awarded by the Cochin Herald.[31][32]
<u>He was listed as one of The 500 Most Influential Muslims in 2014 and 2017</u>.[9][10]<br>
<b><del>Travel bans</del></b><br>
On 31 October 2017, Singapore banned Menk from its borders because it believes he expresses views incompatible with its multicultural laws and policies. According to the Straits Times, he has asserted that "it is blasphemous for Muslims to greet believers of other faiths during festivals such as Christmas or Deepavali". Singapore's Ministry of Home Affairs said in a statement that its decision to reject Menk's application for a short-term work pass stemmed from his "segregationist and divisive teachings".[34][35] The Majlisul Ulama Zimbabwe, Menk's own institution, released a statement to express "regret and dismay" regarding the ban. It said that Menk was an "asset to multi‐cultural, multi‐religious Zimbabwe" and that viewers should "listen to his sermons in full" and not "edited clips of a few minutes" to see the moderate path he has chosen.[36] Mufti Menk actually addressed this issue in a youtube video of his, in which he clarifies that he actually said, that you must not force your beliefs onto others.

In November 2018, the <sub>Danish</sub> <sup>government</sup> banned Menk from entering its borders for 2 years.
